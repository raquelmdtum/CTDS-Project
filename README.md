# Recommendation System for Sephora Skincare Products

## Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a Recommendation System for Sephora skincare products, leveraging data from the [Sephora dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nadyinky/sephora-products-and-skincare-reviews/data). The system focuses on recommending products based on customer reviews, frequent itemsets, and product similarity.

The recommendations are designed to suggest products that users are likely to enjoy, based on:
1. Products frequently reviewed together with positive sentiment.
2. Products similar to the recommended items, identified through ingredient and product similarity.

## Project Structure

### Folders

- **`data/`**: Contains raw, unprocessed data files.
    -  `product_info.csv`: Metadata for skincare products.
    - `reviews_0-250.csv`: Raw reviews directly from the Kaggle dataset.
    - Other similar raw review files (`reviews_250-500.csv`, etc.).
- **`processed_data/`**: Contains pre-processed files for use in the analysis.
    - `skincare.csv`: Cleaned dataset of skincare products.
    - `reviews_0-250.csv`: Processed reviews (split for scalability).
    - Other similar processed review files (`reviews_250-500.csv`, etc.).
    - `combined_reviews.csv`: Includes all reviews already processed.
    - `3_star_positive_reviews.csv`: Contains positive reviews identified through sentiment analysis on 3-star product reviews.
    - `association_rules.csv`: Contains product relationship rules generated using the Apriori algorithm, which identifies frequently bought together products by linking antecedents (input products) to consequents (recommended products).

### Files

- **`recommendation_system.ipynb`**: A single comprehensive notebook implementing the entire workflow for the recommendation system. It integrates data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), sentiment analysis, frequent itemset mining, similarity search, and recommendation logic. Each step aligns with the following components:
  1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Processes raw data into usable formats.
  2. **Sentiment Analysis:** Filters reviews to include only positively rated ones.
  3. **Frequent Items:** Mines association rules from reviews with positive sentiment.
  4. **Similar Items:** Identifies similar skincare products using Reciprocal Rank Fusion on product highlights and ingredients.
  5. **Recommendation System:** Combines association rules and similarity measures to recommend products.

- **`utility.py`**: A Python script providing reusable functions for key tasks, such as preprocessing rules, similarity calculations, and recommendation generation.

## How to Use

- **Run the Comprehensive Notebook:**
   - Open and execute `recommendation_system.ipynb` to clean data, analyze reviews, mine association rules, find similar products, and generate recommendations.


## Example Workflow

1. Sentiment Filtering: <br />
Input: A dataset of products and reviews. <br />
Output: A refined dataset containing only positively rated products for each user.

2. Association Rules: <br />
Input: Refined dataset of liked products. <br />
Output: Rules like "If you liked Product A, you might also like Product B."

3. Similar Items Search: <br />
Input: A product_id of interest. <br />
Output: Ranked list of similar products.

## Challenges and Considerations
- Sentiment Analysis:
    - Challenges with nuanced language (e.g., "not bad" vs. "I didnâ€™t love this").
    - Tendency for less extreme reviews, making classification more ambiguous.
- Association Rules:
    - Balancing data volume for meaningful yet representative rules.
- Similarity Search:
    - Ensuring "similar items" align with user expectations in both functionality and attributes.

## Future Work
- Enhance sentiment analysis for greater contextual understanding.
- Experiment with additional similarity measures or clustering techniques.
- Integrate hybrid models to improve recommendation quality.
